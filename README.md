# hmrc-qualtrics-skin

This is a set of CSS styles that can be applied to a HMRC survey to enchance the default styles so it looks closer to the GDS look and feel.

Only a subset of the available question types are supported, these are:

* Information page, this is normally used at the start of the survey to explain the purpose of the survey and to provide the user with any specific instructions.
* Text input page - Single line / small amount of text
* Text area page - Multiple lines / large amount of text
* Checkboxes - Multiple choice / multiple selections
* Radios - Multiple choice / single selection
